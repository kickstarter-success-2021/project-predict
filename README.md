[Kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is one the world's top crowdfunding platforms, allowing direct-from-consumer funding for products and services of all kinds. Never before in history has it been so easy to ideate, fund, and build new products and services. Over 16 million people across the globe have contributed to 150,000+ successful Kickstarter campaigns. 

How does the site work? Project creators make a page sharing their idea, choose a deadline and a minimum funding goal, and money is collected from consumers ONLY if the project reaches its goal by the deadline. (It's a form of built-in insurance!) Kickstarter then takes a 5% fee on the total amount collected. If a project fails, Kickstarter doesn't benefit. One of the neatest parts of Kickstarter.com is the website is incentivized to help fundraisers be successful: the site only gets paid if the fundraisers reach their goal. 

Our team of three data scientists -- Rhia, Philip, and Lucas -- asked the following question: How can we help Kickstarter fundraisers be even _more_ successful?

Our strategy was simple: 
1. Choose a dataset with the most recent Kickstarter campaign data available (we used Kickstarter datasets collected by this [web scraper](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/))
2. Clean the dataset. We reduced a messy 200,000+ row dataset to a clean, processed 9000+ row dataset with only the most relevant characteristics.
